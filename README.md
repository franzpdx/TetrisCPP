# Tetris C++
This is a Tetris game!

## Purpose

This was my senior project, finished in 2007. It meets requirements through the following features:
* The design is object-oriented.
* It features client-server architecture. There is a multiplayer mode available by launching the server app, where sessions of the Tetris app can connect online using the server's IP. Players can host and join games on the server with up to 4 players in a session.
* A database is used by the server to save high scores. There are database options to either use a SQL Server instance, or to write to a flat (text) file.
* This project uses OpenGL for a 3D graphic environment and FMOD for sound and music.
* An installer is built using the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) which will install the software in Program Files, update the registry, and optionally create shortcuts on the start menu and desktop

Additional features:
* The user can change the size of the playing board. Tetris games tend to have a standard board size, and when experimenting with this feature users may find that difficulty increases quickly as the board width and height are decreased!
* User can select between several different graphic skins for block appearance.

## Notice

This project was built in 2007, using dependencies that have not been maintained. If you attempt to build it in 2021, expect to experience difficulty with these dependencies! As the author, I would like to explore bringing this project over to the Unity environment as another educational exercise.
